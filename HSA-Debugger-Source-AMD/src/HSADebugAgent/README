These files implement a HSA Agent to work with hsail-gdb

The libAMDHSADebugAgent-x64.so is built and injected into the running application by the HSA runtime.
The location and filename for HSADebugAgent.so is passed using a known environment variable.

Build the agent library with HwDbg DBE. For now we use DBE 1.0 

Once you have compiled the agent library,  
if you are using the real HSA-DBE, dont forget to add the DBE path your LD_LIBARY_PATH 
since it is a dynamic library


The Agent can only be used when the application is run within hsail-gdb
The hsailConfigure in the Gdbinit file sets the appropriate environment variables

GDBInit:
The contents of the gdbinit file located within the Agent directory should be appended to the .gdbinit to your home directory
Once you start gdb, you should run: hsailconfigure.

The command hsailconfigure can be added within the init file to always set up gdb for hsail.
